i) Compilation:
  This project, Prog4.java, does not require any arguments when being ran in the command line. When ran, Prog4
  will open with a 'main menu' containing a list of available options for the user to select from. Alternatively,
  the user may also enter 'exit' to close the program. Once a number option has been selected, the user will be
  prompted for any necessary information required by the chosen option.
