i) Compilation:
  The project, Prog4.java, does not require any arguments when being ran in the command line. When run, Prog4
  will open with a 'main menu' containing a list of available options for the user to select from. Alternatively,
  the user may also enter 'exit' to close the program.

ii) Workload Distribution:
  Dylan Carothers II - Responsible for implementing 'Add, update, or delete an equipment inventory record'
    functionality, as well as 'Add, update, or delete an equipment rental record' functionality. This includes
    the methods:
